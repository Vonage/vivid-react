###Deploying new version
When you want to release the latest changes, checkout the latest master branch and simply run

```bash
$ yarn version {minor|major|patch}
```

####Selecting new version number:
- `patch` - fixing some small issue, without new functionality
- `minor` - after adding support for a new component, or adding a new awesome feature
- `major` - after breaking or major package changes

*This is the end*
